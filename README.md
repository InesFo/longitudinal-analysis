# Longitudinal analysis of the effect of lung surgery for severe emphysema

The present study investigates whether respiratory function is improved with surgery in comparison with medical therapy only in patients with severe emphysema.

Because each patient was measured across time, their measurements are not independent. For that reason, I used longitudinal analysis statistical methods to analyse the results.
